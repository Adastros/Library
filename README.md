## About
This project is a simple web application that logs and tracks books users read. Users can manually add, remove, and edit books in the app. A demo button is provided to automatically display some books in the app. Books can be displayed in two view modes: grid (default) or list view. 

Currently, the app does not offer local or online storage for books entered into the app.

 - How to create and implement overlays
 - How to truncate overflowing text with ellipses 
 - Demo buttons can be helpful in demonstrating how an application works
